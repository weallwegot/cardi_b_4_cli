# quotes and wisdom in your terminal. 

------------------------------------
 ### [Project Inspiration](https://andcomputers.io/bars-for-days-chips-with-lays/)

james baldwin, rappers, and various devs.
originally forked from [captainsafia/fortuity](https://github.com/captainsafia/fortuity).


## What

Get a quote or a lyric everytime you start a new terminal session.

## Why

Why not? I love music & I love computers.

## How


The client is written in node and just interacts with the [API](https://github.com/weAllWeGot/CardiB_api) sending either `GET` or `POST` requests. If you add `cardib4cli` to your `~/.bash_profile` with a couple of arguments it will fire up the node app everytime you open a new terminal window and parse the arguments as inputs into the request. The api hangs some times so the client makes sure to end its process after 0.5 seconds in case it doesn't get a response.


### Demo

### Install

```
$ npm install -g cardib4cli
```

#### Execute on startup

To print out a bar from a wise set of individuals every time you launch a new shell, you will
need to configure your shell so that this command runs on startup.

When you configure you have the option to get a completely random quote or to limit the pool from which quotes are chosen or to limit the returned lyrics to just those without offensive language (the `sfw` option). 


The options presented below are essentially command line arguments and you can use any combination of them to specify the catalogue of lyrics you want to pull from. For more information on the api [look here](https://github.com/weAllWeGot/CardiB_api)
